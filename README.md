# unicompose – consistent compose characters, everywhere

I use a lot of different operating systems: macOS, Windows, Linux and even Chrome OS.

Recently, I've watched [Miroslav Šedivý](https://twitter.com/eumiro?lang=de)'s [talk about Compose Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-TlsNUx0RQ) and while I'm not new to the concept, I've decided to give it another try. But, the combinations have to be the same on all of my machines, and of course I don't want to manually keep them in sync.

This project is supposed to generate configs out of a central master config. The documentation is still a bit lacking, but that will improve. It already takes the Chrome OS extension's definition and converts it to a macOS compatible one. More will follow.
